# Set of installer scripts for Arch Linux
This is a set of scripts that I wrote to help with the installation of a functioning Arch Linux machine. At the moment they cover only the post installation part, with all the stuff as DE, Application and personalizations.

I plan to add also some scripts for the first part, even though that is way more delicate and at the moment I prefer to do it by hand each time.

This scripts are inspired from the [ArcoLinuxD](https://arcolinuxd.com/) project, and I modified and changed them to follow my tastes and needs.

Moreover, they load my dotfiles configuration, which is stored [here](https://github.com/jschiavon/dotfiles) and is based on the wonderful use of [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
